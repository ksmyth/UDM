Software requirements and a step-by-step guide to compile UDM source files
on Windows with Visual Studio 2008 (or later)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
-------------------
	- Visual Studio 2008 (or later)
	- J2RE 1.4.2 (or later), Java Runtime Environment 	
	- Java SDK 1.4.2 (or later) 
		- must have JDK installed for compiling C++ Udm!

Step-by-step guide:
-------------------------
	1. Download the UDM sources from the SVN repository:
		https://svn.isis.vanderbilt.edu/MoBIES/UDM/trunk/

	2. Get UDM 3rd party files from:
		\\Atlantis\Project\Mobies\Udm\Udm_ns\3rdparty_vs2008_V1.zip
	and unzip it onto your machine. 

	3. Download the Boost C++ libraries:
		http://www.boost.org/
	and extract into 3rdparty_VS2008 as boost_1_36_0. You needn't compile Boost.

	4. Set your build environment as follows:
		(Note: Use Tools/Options/Projects and Solutions/VC++ Directories to make these settings)
	UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH=
		your UDM 3rdparty root folder (extracted from 3rdparty_vs2008_V1.zip)
	JDK_PATH=
		your Java 1.4.2 (or later) SDK path, e.g. c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16
		(Note: Once the above variables are set, you may use Projects/Win32/VC9/src/set-paths.bat to set following)
	UDM_PATH=
		your UDM SVN root folder (where /MoBIES/UDM/trunk/ is checked out)
	PATH=
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\xerces-c_2_8_0\bin;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\xalan-c_1_11_0\bin;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\cppunit-1.12.1\bin;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\info-zip;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\sed;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\swigwin-1.3.36;
		%PATH%
	INCLUDE=
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\xerces-c_2_8_0\include;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\Xalan-C_1_11_0\include;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\antlr-2.7.7\lib\cpp;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\zlib;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\zlib\contrib\minizip;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\cppunit-1.12.1\include;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\boost_1_36_0;
		%JDK_PATH%\include\win32;
		%JDK_PATH%\include;
		%INCLUDE%
	LIB=
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\Xalan-C_1_11_0\lib;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\xerces-c_2_8_0\lib;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\zlib;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\antlr-2.7.7\lib;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\cppunit-1.12.1\lib;
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\boost_1_36_0\lib;
		%JDK_PATH%\lib
		%LIB%
	CLASSPATH=
		%UDM_3RDPARTY_PATH%\antlr-2.7.7\antlr.jar;
		%CLASSPATH%

	4. Open Udm.sln in VS 2008, and (re)build solution with the following configurations: 
			'Win32 Debug' and 
			'Win32 Release'

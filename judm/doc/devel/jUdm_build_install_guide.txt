The requirements and a step-by-step guide to compile jUdm source files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
-------------------
	The step-by-step guide to compile jUdm source files must be completed
	J2SK 1.4.2 as Java Runtime Environment 

	This document uses <udm_ns> to denote the root of the UDM_NS sources.

Step-by-step guide:
-------------------------

	1. Versioning

		The <udm_ns>\judm\etc folder contains the manifest files that will be added to the 
		judm.jar when compiling the jUdm core classes. Check out this manifest and increase the
		verison number if necessary.

		Similarly, <udm_ns>\judm\samples\GeneTF\etc, <udm_ns>\judm\samples\GeneTRE\etc, and
		<udm_ns>\judm\samples\SBML2Ex\etc folders contain the manifest files that will be added
		to the domain-specific jars when compiling these domain-specific generated classes.
		Check out these manifest files and increment the version numbers whenever applicable.

	2. Open a command shell and go to the directory <udm_ns>\judm

	3. Using ANT you have to run the following target:

		ant dist-all
			Target “dist-all” initializes the build’s distribution environment 
			(<udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win) after completely removing any previous builds
			from the disk, copies the necessary dll-s into this build directry, 
			updates, re-generates, and compiles the swig and domain-specific source codes, 
			generates javadoc API documentation, and updates the domain-specific distribution 
			by generating the necessary zip files in <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win\dist in case
			you use windows or in <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_linux\dist in case you use linux.

	4. InstallShield

		4.1 Create a group (optional) in the install wizard for the jUdm core module
		4.2 Add <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win\dist\judm to this newly created group
		4.3 Create a group (optional) in the install wizard for the jUdm samples
		4.4 Add <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win\dist\GeneTF to this newly created samples group
		4.5 Add <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win\dist\GeneTRE to this newly created samples group
		4.6 Add <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win\dist\SBML2Ex to this newly created samples group

			When the user intalls the UDM, he or she should be able to decide whether to install 
			the jUdm or not; moreover, he or she sould be able to decide whether to install the 
			samples with the jUdm or not. The directory structure can follow the following
			directory structure:

			<some_udm_install>...\judm
			<some_udm_install>...\judm\samples\GeneTF
			<some_udm_install>...\judm\samples\GeneTRE
			<some_udm_install>...\judm\samples\SBML2Ex

		4.7 Create the environment variable JUDM_PATH:

			JUDM_PATH=<some_udm_install>...\judm

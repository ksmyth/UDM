The requirements and a step-by-step guide to compile jUdm source files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
-------------------
	The step-by-step guide to compile jUdm source files must be completed
	J2SK 1.4.2 as Java Runtime Environment 

Step-by-step guide:
-------------------------

	1. Open a command shell and go to the directory <udm_ns>\judm. 

		Using ANT you have run the following targets

		ant dist-all
			Target “dist-all” initializes the build’s distribution environment 
			(<udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win) after completely removing it from the disk, 
			copies the necessary dll-s into this build directry, 
			updates, re-generates, and compiles the swig and domain-specific source codes, 
			generates javadoc API documentation, and updates the domain-specific distribution 
			by generating the necessary jar files in <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win\dist in case
			you use windows or in <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_linux\dist in case you use linux.

	2. InstallShield

		2.1 Create a group (optional) in the install wizard for the jUdm core module
		2.2 Add <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win\dist\judm to this newly created group
		2.3 Create a group (optional) in the install wizard for the jUdm samples
		2.4 Add <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win\dist\GeneTF to this newly created samples group
		2.5 Add <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win\dist\GeneTRE to this newly created samples group
		2.6 Add <udm_ns>\judm\build\build_win\dist\SBML2Ex to this newly created samples group

			When the user intalls the UDM, he or she should be able to decide whether to install 
			the jUdm or not; moreover, he or she sould be able to decide whether to install the 
			samples with the jUdm or not. The directory structure can follow the following
			directory structure:

			<some_udm_install>...\judm
			<some_udm_install>...\judm\samples\GeneTF
			<some_udm_install>...\judm\samples\GeneTRE
			<some_udm_install>...\judm\samples\SBML2Ex

		2.7 Create the environment variable JUDM_PATH:

			JUDM_PATH=<some_udm_install>...\judm

  xerces-c-devel, xalan-c, xalan-c-devel, minizip, minizip-devel,
  minizip-libs, pccts

Build-environment preparation (Fedora Core 4):
----------------------------------------------

  Fedora Core/Extras:
  ant, ant-junit, ant-trax, cppunit-devel, java-sdk, junit,
  swig and xml-commons-apis

Building:
---------------------
- build udm, judm and the tests on Windows;
  run %UDM_PATH%\etc\ArchiveModelFiles.bat; it will create
  %UDM_PATH%\model-files.zip, an archive with the model data files generated
  on Windows
- clean judm and use "Clean solution" to clean the tests and udm
- copy or share the tree obtained above to your Linux installation
- in the top directory run
  make clean
  make
- to run the tests launch the following command in the top directory:
  make check
- to build a rpm launch the following command in the top directory:
  make rpm
